cypher-vim-syntax
=================

What is it?
-----------
This is a basic Vim syntax for the awesome [http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html](Cypher) graph database query language.  Cypher is like SQL for graph databases.

Why should I use it?
--------------------

Because syntax highlighting is really helpful, that's why.  Also, we want people to be able to do ad-doc queries and graph updates in their favourite shell, and not compromise readability, etc.

How should I use it?
--------------------

* Install the awesome [https://github.com/tpope/pathogen](pathgen) plugin.
* cd .vim/bundle
* git clone git://github.com/simpsonjulian/cypher-vim-syntax.git
* edit a file that has the extension **.cyp**

Who should I thank?
-------------------

* @robinedwards for extending the syntax
* @davidszotten for making it work with pathogen
